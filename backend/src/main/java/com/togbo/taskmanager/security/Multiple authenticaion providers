how to implements a CustomAuthentication and a DefaultAuthentication (API KEY , HTTP BASIC)
both of them are Filters
In a real world app i will usually have maxim 2 default filters

A Custom Authentication will need it`s own Authentication Manager, Provider
A Default Authentication can use same Authentication Manager, Provider together with other Default Authentication
